    <h2>Week 14 Essay</h2>

    <div>

      <p>This was the last week of the third phase of the academy, which means that the open-source phase is over, and
        while it was a phase in which I learned a lot about the main stacks that I'm working with, I still feel a little
        disappointed because until this day, I haven’t been able to do any contributions yet.</p>

      <p>And to be honest this makes me feel really weird about what my future is going to be inside the academy, cause
        this was supposed to be what I should deliver, the expected results of the phase, I understand that the main goal
        of this is to prepare us for what’s coming ahead, which is to land a job with one of the company’s clients, and
        this phase was supposed to help us start understanding big codebases and also to make us feel more confident about
        our skills by contributing to the open-source world, but while I do feel more confident about my skills and my
        knowledge, once again, I haven’t yet made any PR to any projects, and at a certain point that really made me doubt
        about my skills.</p>

      <p>This week I’ve been learning more about Rails (which I consider to be my main framework for now) and about its
        Active Records model, which for a while was something that was really confusing to me, and after a lot of reading
        and dividing concepts, diving deeper and deeper I was able to understand everything and to finally say that I'm
        sure of what it is about, and that made me sure of one thing, sometimes I take longer to understand certain
        things, but I have to go to the core of them to understand something, cause I'm never comfortable with just
        covering the outside of things.</p>

      <p>I think that’s why since I started learning how to code, I decided that someday I'd be a full stack developer (I
        know this may not be a brilliant comparison since front-end is not easier than back-end), because I wanted to
        understand the whole process, from what the users see in the webpage to how the gears worked behind the screen,
        this reminds me of a story they told us in university about a musician in the renaissance that wanted to write,
        compose, build the theatre and sing in it, pretty much do it all, and while the objective was not the same, I
        firmly believe there is a common wish of a deeper understanding before acting.</p>

      <p>I know it may not be the right approach all the time, I just feel it’s the way it’s been for me for. Along time,
        and whenever I'm learning to do something new, I'm more curious than I'd like, unfortunately, that curiosity
        hasn’t led me to quick understanding of things, as some may expect.</p>

      <p>I don’t leave this phase without learning, even though I haven’t yet contributed to any project, I'm willing to do
        so, better late than never they say, and in the next days I will see what (if any) my options are. I’ve talked a
        lot with my mentors and with the education team which have offered me a lot of help, and I’m really grateful for
        it, I will keep on studying and learning more about my main stacks until I'm ready to be a good programmer, the
        Academy has so far done a lot for me and I couldn’t be more thankful for being a part of it, for having the
        chance.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Week 13 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>This is the essay for the Academy’s 13th week, we finished and started a very busy week, working in our
        projects and
        still trying to do contributions for the open-source community, it is a really hard phase and of course, really
        busy
        too, but I feel that at least personally I'm learning a lot even though I'm still having a hard time with
        contributing
        to one of those projects.</p>

      <p>I’ve been getting a good grasp of the main stacks I'm studying, and it’s weird, but the main stack that I’ve
        had since I
        started studying was Ruby, starting with that one and learning Ruby on Rails after it, but now I feel a little
        more
        inclined for JavaScript, I'm not really sure what it was, I guess it’s part of what somebody from the education
        team
        told me about getting to really understand a program internally, and while Ruby really does have a lot of magic
        and I
        enjoy using it, I feel like I should learn things a little more in-depth so I can continue and move onto harder
        things.</p>

      <p>I’ve been learning a lot about vanilla ruby and JavaScript, and not only about their frameworks, and I started
        doing
        that because I ran into some troubles when studying their frameworks, sometimes I felt that there were some
        ambiguities
        between what I was learning and how I could precisely implement that with the language itself, so I decided to
        take a
        step back and re-learn some things so I don’t leave things like that.</p>

      <p>I’ve also started to read a lot of documentation about them, because I really want to dive deep into the
        languages and
        really understand what’s going on, I may seem a little obsessed with that, but I just do it so I can make sure
        of doing
        things right, at first, I started with crash courses but I felt like I was just learning a very superficial part
        of
        things, I think that’s mainly why I'm doing this now.</p>

      <p>I also started looking and trying to understand the Rails gem, devise, looking though the issues so I could
        contribute
        to its open-source project, and I've still had a hard time trying to understand it all, not quite sure why, I
        may not be
        taking the right approach for it, but still doing my best so I can at least solve 1 issue for this phase.</p>

      <p>And that’s been what I've been doing this last week, quite a weird-feeling week since I feel like the time goes
        by
        incredibly fast and there’s just so much to do and learn, life may not be long enough.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Week 12 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">
      <p>This last week was basically the end of our 3rd month already at the academy, and it’s kind of an interesting
        feeling
        being here, because at the beginning I was really nervous of what it would be like, and it felt like I wouldn’t
        be able
        to do much, and each phase feels really different than the one that came before, and I struggle a lot, but at
        the end I
        end learning a lot and making it, so I understand the demanding aspect of the project.</p>

      <p>This open-source phase we’re in right now has studying a lot every single day, from dawn to dusk, trying to
        understand
        as many concepts as fast as possible, because there is just so much to learn and the days go by really fast.</p>

      <p>I’ve been learning a lot about my main stacks, which I consider to be mostly ruby and ruby on rails, and also
        been
        learning a lot of Javascript and React as my secondary stack. However, I find myself struggling a lot when it
        comes to
        big codebases, which is also part of what we’re supposed to learn from in this phase, so I'd say the Academy’s
        objectives nailed it at least from my perspective.</p>

      <p>This week I’ve been searching a lot for projects that I may fit in, but I've been having some problems to
        actually find
        one. I don’t really know if it’s the fact that ruby is not as used (or at least that’s what it looks like) as
        other
        languages like python or java, but it seems like there aren’t a lot of open-source projects specially with
        issues for
        beginners, and that’s actually something that I was talking about with my mentors.</p>

      <p>I also had the chance to speak with the education team about my situation which really helped me see the big
        picture,
        and focus on what really matters in this phase, and after that I felt relieved, because part of all of this is
        learning
        how to communicate, the job of a programmer is probably going to always be to work as a team with your
        co-workers, so
        learning how to express when things are not going well is definitely something that I've been learning a lot in
        here.</p>

      <p>On the other side I’ve been learning a lot about rest API’s and how to do http requests in both of my stacks,
        and to be
        honest I’m starting to feel a little bit more inclined to turn Javascript into my main language, because as I've
        been
        told, ruby can sometimes be “too magical” and one can lose some knowledge in the process, and I really want to
        understand what’s going on in the backstage.</p>

      <p>So that’s pretty much what I’ve been doing for this week and I got to say that never thought being a developer
        or that
        the way to becoming one would be so full of ups and downs, how can sit behind a computer be such a journey,
        well, I
        guess all it took to understand it was actually doing it, and I don’t regret it for a single day.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Week 11 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>This week has been one of the toughest weeks I’ve had since the start of the academy, and it’s been one of the
        toughest
        not only because of the technical challenge and for how much knowledge I’ve needed to acquire to fulfill the
        goals that
        have been set for it, but also because of external reasons which made it even harder to achieve.</p>

      <p>This week I had a lot of blockers due to family circumstances related to health, and it turned out incredibly
        time
        absorbing, it was hard enough already for me to keep up with the tasks and all the research we’ve been doing
        throughout
        the program, and now with this it just turned out into something that I couldn’t handle as I would have liked.
      </p>

      <p>Personally, I feel a little down, if not a lot, because I thought the whole week that I’d be able to get to the
        objectives despite the situation, but as the days went by, I started struggling even more, specially these last
        two
        days.</p>

      <p>I read and researched a lot about what I was supposed to do this week, I feel like l learned a lot about the
        topics, and
        at times I felt my brain a little overcharged, and this is something that I've been feeling since I started
        here, not in
        a negative way, but it’s just something that has a lot to do with the fact that I'm still compensating and
        learning
        things that I was never taught, and every now and then turn into very time-consuming tasks. I still enjoy
        learning about
        it, and I know every single piece of knowledge is going to help me a lot so that makes it feel fine.</p>

      <p>I read a lot about the open-source world this week, and realized that there are a lot of things that even
        though we may
        think are easy, are probably not so much. What I try to say with this is that, a lot of details (most of them
        related to
        soft skills) we can give them for granted that we will be good at, and when you actually start doing things, you
        realize
        the truth.</p>

      <p>This week I felt the pressure as I’ve never done before in the academy, and though sometimes we may think that
        we work
        better under pressure, it’s not that way all the time, and that happened to me. For the first time in months, I
        let my
        brain play some mental games with me which really hurt my performance, and couldn’t get to what I wanted/needed
        to
        comply with by today.</p>

      <p>Struggled a lot with open-source projects, my main stack since I started studying is Ruby, and I started
        working with
        ruby on rails just a little time ago, so a lot of things still are hard and as anything, you need to understand
        it
        pretty well to actually do things. I also took JS as part of my second stack, with react, and for some reason I
        haven’t
        been able to get into a project or projects in which I can actually help, and that’s really frustrating.</p>

      <p>I had never studied as much as I'm doing now, and feeling the pressure has taken its toll, having me stuck and
        overthinking at times that I may not understand something by the time I need it, and that it will affect me
        directly by
        not being able to do as well as my colleagues.</p>

      <p>Probably I sound very negative with all of this, just for the record I want to say that I'm not, it’s just the
        feeling
        of not doing as well as you expect, but I'm still working hard because I know persistency is all it takes.</p>

      <p>So as this text may already suggest it, I'm still on the process of finding suitable OS projects and
        unfortunately
        delayed with the objectives, therefore, I don’t have my two extra questions/answers, however, I've read a lot
        about my
        first question and here it is.</p>

      <h3>How ActiveRecords works internally?</h3>

      <p>Active records work in rails as an interface to work directly with the database, creating objects with the data
        for
        persistent use with the DB, is what is also called an ORM (object relational mapping).</p>

      <p>The objects created with active records carry data with themselves and lets the controllers access that data in
        a
        different way than it would be worked with if it was directly to the database.</p>

      <p>It does this by using tables in a relational database management system, it stores the properties and relations
        of
        objects and lets us access them without having to use SQL syntax, making it easier to manage with less code, and
        that
        also gives you the same abilities to work with the data, such as representing models and their data,
        representing
        associations between those models, representing inheritance hierarchies through related models, validating
        models before
        they get persisted to a database and performing database operations the object-oriented way.</p>

      <p>Once again, all of this is made by creating objects that inherit from the ActiveRecords class, and it’s made
        following
        naming conventions in the models and the databases, which is a pretty important part of it. It is really
        important
        because rails creates the mapping for these objects following those same conventions, by default rails will
        pluralize
        the names of the classes to comply with the database tables.</p>

      <p>If a class is called Dog, the database table will be called Dogs, and this is made automatically inside rails,
        it has a
        pluralization mechanism that is really good and is able to pluralize regular and irregular words, that why I
        mention the
        importance of name conventions. Also, when creating these classes and tables, rails will follow the convention
        of
        letting the classes be camel case, and the tables will be the same name but the words are separated with
        underscores.</p>

      <p>In order to create an active records model all you have to do is to define a new class that inherits from
        “ActiveRecords::base” which will automatically create the class that will now be a “product” of ActiveRecords,
        and will
        send its corresponding table to the database.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Week 10 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>This last week we started with the new phase of the academy which is the Open Source one, and to me it really
        felt like
        a gamechanger since we’ll be working in projects with bigger databases, along people from all around the world,
        and the
        fact that I’ve never worked in something like this before feels a little challenging, just hard enough to take
        us out of
        the comfort zone.</p>

      <p>And to make this even harder/interesting we’re the ones supposed to look for the open-source projects that
        we’ll be
        working in which makes it feel more (because it is) like the real thing, starting to collaborate with other
        people,
        having to read, analyze and understand their code, the way in which they work, so we can adjust to the ways of
        their
        project.</p>

      <p>I read a lot about open source and how it does a lot of good for the programming community, by letting new and
        experienced programmers work together, letting them learn from each other, and improving (most of the time) the
        way we
        do things by simply understanding the way other programmers make possible certain things (but yes, we should
        only focus
        on the good practices cause there’s all types of code out there).</p>

      <p>I’ve been learning also a lot about data structures, not only in my “main stacks” but trying to understand the
        concepts
        just in a general CS way, I don’t come from a CS background so I often feel like there are a lot of things I may
        be
        omitting, so just want to be sure of knowing enough to start going for that “more than enough”, to go beyond.
      </p>

      <p>I also learned some things in a weird, or probably not weird but unexpected way, and that is because I started
        looking
        for/reviewing some projects, some I found interesting, some others not that much, anyway, started seeing some
        issues in
        which I could probably do my part, and sent messages to see if I could contribute, and also read the requisites.
        The bad
        thing is that by now I haven’t yet gotten an answer and if I keep on waiting, I won’t make it on time for the
        phase
        deadlines, so I learned that the bad way, and also, we received some feedback from our education team.</p>

      <p>Unfortunately, because of this same reason I don’t have yet my two questions, I thought of questions that I
        could use
        but since I'm not sure yet if I'll work on those projects, I may change them, so I'll try to speed up that part.
        Therefore, the status of my contributions remains “looking for OS projects”.</p>

      <p>I’m also still working on the premade question I got from the spreadsheet and I feel like I've learned a lot
        just by
        researching how Active Records works in Rails, and I feel excited since rails is one of the things that I'm the
        most
        interested because of being part of my main stack.</p>

      <p>I have yet not defined the topic of the blog post that I'll do, but I'm thinking of something related to all
        the things
        that I'm learning right now about the main stacks I have, and how can I apply that to help in open source.</p>

    </div>

    <h2>Monthly essay no.2</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>I had some trouble to decide how to start this one, not because I have nothing to say but because I probably
        have much
        more than I expected. This is the second monthly essay that I'm writing which means that I've been part of the
        academy
        for two months by now, and it feels really strange to me.</p>

      <p>It feels really strange for a lot of reasons, and the strangest of them all for me is when I stop and look back
        at the
        month of June of the last year, when I decided to fulfill one of my dreams since I was a kid, which was learning
        how to
        code.</p>

      <P>Being part of this project when I didn’t even have a year of starting to learn on my own has been everything
        but easy,
        it’s been a challenge every single day, of course the impostor’s syndrome has been around and one can feel
        insecure of
        not being capable of doing much, but I feel so thankful for being here and to be learning so much of all the
        wonderful
        people working in this company.</P>

      <P>Never thought that I’d be working in a project like the one we worked on this last month by now, it feels
        unreal and I'm
        working hard to keep up with it most of the time, I've been studying and learning non-stop for two months now,
        and
        somehow, I don’t feel tired of it, which is not an easy thing at least for me, I'm someone who gets bored
        easily, but
        when it comes to this, I can say that I'm so excited to continue learning and improving to achieve my goals.</P>

      <P>This last month I worked with an amazing team that never let me down, and I've learned a lot from them, and not
        only
        from them but also from my mentors and from the community, I struggle with something new every single day, but
        by the
        end of the day (sometimes it takes longer) I learned something that I didn’t know before, and that’s progress.
      </P>

      <P>I’m not going to say it was easy, it was not, I suffered and got desperate, and felt like I wasn’t progressing
        and that
        I'd never make it as a programmer and that I should probably stick to something else and all that jazz, but
        that’s
        breaking the shell, getting exposed, and exposure isn’t easy, nothing that’s worth it will ever be easy.</P>

      <P>With all of this what I'm trying to say is that I understand why some things are hard, and why they are
        happening this
        way, I'm enjoying this emotional rollercoaster and I'm willing to be in this ride until the end, even though
        some curves
        may be scary, I’m learning a lot and I like it, now more than ever I feel like this is something I want to do
        for a long
        time.</P>

    </div>

    <h2>Week 9 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>This last week in the Academy definitely felt different than the rest, it was in a certain way a little more
        laid back
        than the others, probably because we already understood how we work as a team after a month of doing so, and
        everything
        was a little better organized than before.</p>

      <p>The knowledge that we’ve been acquiring over these weeks is really something that I wasn’t expecting to get,
        because
        even though I feel like I may not be learning that much every day, when I look back and think of what I knew
        before, I
        realize how much I've really learned and that makes me feel like I'm really progressing, which of course makes
        me feel
        more comfortable with the work I'm doing.</p>

      <p>And not only myself but I also recognize and see how my teammates are progressing incredibly well, it’s really
        interesting to see how people can evolve so quickly in such a good way.</p>

      <p>The fact that we’ve been working in a project has made us learn a lot of new things, though of course these
        things are
        totally related and work in the environment of the project, they are definitely going to help us and be useful
        when we
        start working in something different, even if that’s totally unrelated to this project.</p>

      <p>There are of course certain things that we struggled with, and that we’re still trying to get the hang of, and
        even
        though sometimes it feels like you’re reaching the “final lap” and that you will eventually not have to struggle
        that
        much, I've realized it’s part of what being a developer is all about, and it’s not about reaching a certain
        amount of
        knowledge or level, but getting used to this way of continuously learning and adapting to new things.</p>

      <p>We reached the goals that we had for this week, we feel good for now, I feel good for now, and I'm excite to
        see what
        the new phase of the Academy will bring, a little scared too, but that’s just part of it.</p>

    <h2>Week 8 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>There’s a phrase that we learned here in the Academy that keeps on coming back to my mind every single day
        since a few
        weeks ago, and it is that programming is much more about dealing with people than dealing with computers. I
        remember
        that because in fact, now that we’re working on a project, it’s an everyday thing, talk with your teammates, be
        in
        meetings, talk with your mentors and teams, talk with your clients, and of course, to deal with every aspect
        that comes
        with it.</p>

      <p>With this I definitely don’t mean that it’s a struggle, there are of course some struggles, but it’s not the
        whole
        thing, in fact in can be quite fulfilling and you can learn a lot from it, which of course gives you a lot to
        think and
        leaves you with a feeling of progress.</p>

      <p>From my perspective I can say that I’ve struggled more than computers than with people for the moment, and this
        because
        my team is full of people that I totally respect, they are so smart and charming, I really like these people,
        and
        working with them makes everything much easier, or better at least.</p>

      <p>I’ve been having some issues with my own knowledge, most of the time I feel like I don’t catch certain concepts
        as fast
        as my colleagues, and of course this is reflected in how fast I can work, how I deliver results. This hasn’t
        made it
        easier for me, since often the thoughts of me becoming a burden for the team fly around my head.</p>

      <p>This doesn’t mean that I'm totally down and crying on the floor (although I scream inside every now and then),
        but have
        been working extra hard and studied more in both content and hours than I’ve ever done before, and while this is
        of
        course, tiring, it’s what I have to do if I really want to progress and overcome these barriers that have been
        stopping
        me from going to “the next level”.</p>

      <p>I’ve been learning a lot about the front end, JavaScript and React, tried to learn more and more concepts, and
        things
        that maybe I skipped or didn’t realize were there because of not having a computer science background, I feel
        very
        motivated but at the same time I feel a little scared of not learning enough to make it with what the Academy
        expects
        from us, and though this may sound negative, I don’t mean it that way, I guess it’s just my way to say that I'll
        try and
        see what is there for me.</p>

      <p>But will keep on trying, definitely will keep on trying.</p>

    <h2>Week 7 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>They say that is in our darkest or toughest moments when we find the inspiration to get up and do something
        instead of
        just complaining about it and let yourself fade. I think in a certain way I hit a spiritual rock bottom because
        of the
        feeling of not doing or being enough, al derived from the fact that I struggled like never before with the tasks
        or the
        material that I should learn for the current project we’re working on.</p>

      <p>This week we’ve been working extra hard with the project for our client and honestly, I hadn’t felt this
        pressure since
        the Academy started, not only because it is really an important project but also because of the work we’re
        supposed to
        do here.</p>

      <p>It’s taken us to the extreme, for some of us that had never worked as a team of developers before, applying
        agile
        practices for example, dividing certain tasks and having to think all the time on how those tasks correlate with
        what
        our colleagues are doing at the moment, every single step has to be given some thought in order for it to work.
      </p>

      <p>And I’ve felt weak for a few days, not only in spirit but also as a developer, started feeling certain lack of
        knowledge
        or that I was probably not good enough, took me a while to understand that we may come from different
        backgrounds and
        that we’re all learning at a different pace, even though we’re working on the same things.</p>

      <p>And after all of this I still feel really glad and fortunate that I've been given the chance to prove myself,
        and
        twisted that mentality, instead of letting myself down decided to fight until the last moment, learning as much
        JS and
        React in this case as I can everyday so I can develop some skill, and of course, the app.</p>

    <h2>Week 6 Essay</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>It is really curious how humans are able to “shape” to whatever they need to, how we evolve and adapt to
        survive, and
        not only to survive, but sometimes in search of self-improvement. Some other times this change comes naturally
        when we
        are in need, when the situation requires it, and that is a big part of our life cycle.
      </p>

      <p>I’ve felt this pressure to adapt a lot of times in my life, sometimes it’s been tough to do it, and other times
        I've
        liked it and felt excited about it. Anyway, it’s always been an interesting and cultivating experience, we are
        curious
        beings and though at times we feel challenged and afraid of diving into the unknown, we transcend through doing
        these
        things.
      </p>

      <P>Since we started the academy, it’s been a constant cycle of learning, sometimes you even think before going to
        sleep,
        and after you wake up, you think all the time in what you’re doing, never learned so fast before, and I am now
        adapting
        to this new process, this new phase, actually building something, and yes, it is from scratch.
      </P>

      <P>This process has been challenging and interesting, because even when we read a lot of material about agile and
        planning
        how to work on a project, it’s a totally different thing to actually do it, now I understand what they meant by
        “Coding
        is more about dealing with people than with machines”, and I'm starting to dig it.</P>


      <P>Working and thinking all the time in what we should do, how we should do it, why we should do it, is it
        suitable? is it
        going to give us nightmares? will it actually be helpful or will the client like it? Lots of questions and not
        so many
        answers, guess we’ll have to get them on the way. But it’s amazing to apply the acquired knowledge in a project,
        to
        understand every piece because black swans don’t give you a notice in advance, thinking about making you program
        robust
        and prevent it from being fragile, understanding how to work as a team, every piece of what we can take from the
        past
        and the present will help us build now and in the future.</P>

    <h2>Review of Make it stick</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>I think this book was right in pretty much everything that was written in it, and reminded me a lot about the
        coursera
        course of learning how to learn because they go through a lot of the same concepts but probably seen in
        different ways,
        which also makes it interesting, because it reinforces the ideas while explaining different methods to do so.
      </p>

      <p>The book talks about how we learn, how we often think that we are learning based on the methods that we use to
        learn and
        of course how we may be doing it in the wrong way, as we often rely on repetition-based learning which ends up
        not
        actually adding up to our brain development.</p>

      <p>So, since the way we often learn may be incorrect and we are probably wasting more time than we should or not
        learning
        as much because of these issues we got in derived by our ways of learning, it’s time to fix those little
        problems and
        these misconceptions we have about it so we can improve, and this has a lot to do with the mentioned illusions
        of
        knowing and the myths surrounding them.</p>

      <p>Some of the things that are repeated through the steps this book covers are also covered in the other course
        mentioned,
        and those are the spaced repetition and also interleaving which pretty much consists in keeping up with the
        knowledge
        you get so you store in in your long-term memory, and to make your studying sessions diverse so you can maintain
        your
        concentration as much as possible.</p>

      <p>To be honest at certain point I felt like this book was going over and over through the same concepts but just
        explaining the with different words and that they could have save so much time if they were a little more
        concise, but
        of course, since the book was meant for people in general for learning these concepts we can’t just assume it
        will be
        the same for everyone, we all learn different, but luckily, we can all use the same techniques to improve the
        way we
        learn which is the main objective of the book.</p>

    <h2>Review of Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware & Software</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>Code, was easily one of the most complete books I've ever read about how computers work, it explains very
        exhaustively
        every single detail about how computers were made, and it does it covering a lot of aspects, that in the
        beginning may
        not be or feel like they are related with computing, but each bit of information that’s explained there is well
        thought
        and translates into very important knowledge that will help us understand better how something works, and why it
        works
        when taken to the computers world.</p>

      <p>The fact that it begins explaining about how morse code works and relating it to the binary concept of how
        computers
        understand the simplest orders is a very good example of it.</p>

      <p>Passing right after that to de-chunking how flashlights work and how we can use them to communicate under the
        same
        binary concept, from the easiest parts to the more complicated ones, always trying to improve communication and
        using it
        for the best, to later on move onto how this same principle was taken to the telegraph and simultaneously how
        they
        solved the problems with its intensity by explaining each electrical problem they had with it in a very detailed
        way.
      </p>
      <p>All of this knowledge ends up used to make us understand how we used all of these components we already had and
        were
        able to “branch” decisions via the boolean values, how processors work and the way all of these parts work
        together to
        create the first computers.</p>

      <p>Without a doubt this book is something that goes beyond my expectations in a matter of how complete it was and
        also
        regarding the material and the way the development of its material is, I feel like they couldn’t have been
        clearer with
        a lot of concepts, such as when it starts talking about software and how to write it with the “machine code”.
      </p>

      <p>Definitely a book worth reading if you’re interested in computers and software development, but even more if
        you’re
        someone who actually cares about the functionality of each single part of it, because it goes over every step
        with a lot
        of detail, which makes it much more interesting than to just explain the main concept and moving on.</p>

    <h2>Opinion about the course "Learn how to learn"</h2>

    <div class="essay">

      <p>Reading the learn how to learn course was a very interesting thing for me, because honestly at the beginning I
        felt like
        it would be a total waste of my time, and I thought this because we had a class about this exact same thing at
        my
        university and I learned nothing in a whole semester, the class was boring, the material they taught us was not
        really
        useful and the teacher never really looked like she cared about it either, actually at a certain point she said
        she was
        there just to fill her schedule, so you can guess it wasn’t good at all.</p>
      <p>
        But how wrong I was to compare this course to the class that I previously had; those were totally different
        worlds. In
        this course I was able to learn step by step what I was doing wrong with a lot of my learning methods and also
        about the
        things that I did wrong no matter what I was learning at the moment.</p>
      <p>
        They talked and covered subjects from really easy topics and little details that one can actually notice in
        plain sight
        to very complicated stuff and techniques, explaining how those affect the way our brains and the way in which we
        acquire
        new knowledge.</p>

      <P>We also learned a lot about how our brains process the information and learned some very good and interesting
        things
        about neuro science, the fact that exercising could help you keep your neurons healthy or sleeping could create
        new
        space for synapses to help us with learning much better, those were things that I would have never imagined, and
        definitely will be putting more attention to.
      </P>
      <P>Every little thing that I learned from the course will remain in my memory and I'll practice it and go over it
        again so
        I can (as mentioned in the course) keep it in my long-term memory, cause these chunks of information I got
        deserve a
        very special place in my head, where I'll be storing much more knowledge.
      </P>

    <h2>Monthly essay no.1</h2>

    <div class="essay" id="ensayo-mensual-1">

      <p>This first month in Encoracademy has been definitely a rollercoaster in a lot of senses to me, it’s been a lot
        of things
        but easy, it has challenged me in so many ways that I could hardly explain it or put it in words, not only
        because we
        are constantly learning and at times, I may feel overwhelmed, and at certain points I feel that I’m maybe not
        good
        enough or that I simply cannot get in the right motion to get along with this project’s pace.</p>

      <p>It has put me in rough situations where I've been forced to get to a level of commitment that I was probably
        not used
        to, and of course that I'm making an incredibly tough effort to somewhat be at the level of my colleagues. That
        is also
        something that has made me deceive myself as well, the impostor’s syndrome has hit hard and gotten me really bad
        at
        certain times, I had been warned that this would be tough and of course that some things are easier said than
        done, but
        I said that I'd do it and here I am, which makes me feel really grateful.</p>

      <p>Even though one can feel that you have everything against you every now and then, I look back a month ago and
        realize
        that I have probably not been putting enough attention on the positive sides of this, because I wouldn’t have
        imagined
        to learn so much in such a short time, and I realize now that everything involved in the material and the
        lessons we
        receive from our mentors and all the team in the Academy are slowly and softly changing us from head to toe, in
        a good
        way of course.</p>

      <p>We’re learning so much and so fast, building this knowledge, this mindset every single day, sometimes hidden in
        the
        tasks that we got, that we don’t even notice, it took me until a few days ago to start actually realizing all of
        this
        and when it clicked, it made me understand that this may be what overcoming yourself could feel like.</p>

      <p>This I say it cause I've failed, and I’ve had to recognize my failures, just to realize that this was all part
        of what
        would improve the way I do things, and I now feel empowered to try so many things in a lot of different ways,
        the
        courses about learning, the tasks we’ve gotten as a team, the meetings, the lessons, the lectures and the
        videos,
        everything has been forming me and now I'm starting to actually embrace and let the knowledge run through my
        veins (yes
        I'm being over dramatic here).</p>

      <p>No one warned me that when welcomed to the magic, the magic would hit this way, but I understand now what it
        consists
        of, and I'm more than ready to continue becoming a wizard, if that makes any sense.</p>

    <h2>Week 4 essay</h2>

    <div class="essay" id="ensayo-4">
      <p>What a ride the one we’re on right now, the beginning was unknown, the road got some weird turns and the
        future, well, the future remains
        uncertain. What are we speaking of, though? Are we talking about a rollercoaster ride, a Sunday afternoon car
        drive, a year that unexpectedly
        went weird, your journey in this new job you got, the universe, life itself? Well, while those can be identified
        as rides, we could be talking
        about each one of them at the same time, at the end of the day, aren’t those all co-existing just the way we
        humans co-exist with one another? </p>
      <p>As mentioned by Seth Lloyd we could be immersed in this universe where our species created these computers that
        allow us to create and work to
        create things inside the ones that were already created, and well, it goes on and on. </p>
      <p>The universe may be creating its own instances of matter in order to let some other parts of it create some
        other things using that same matter
        as an argument passed to its inner functions, initializing life, instantiating all we know, and everything we’ve
        inherited from the beginning of
        times until this moment in which we’ve began to wonder if isn’t life itself a big computer.</p>
      <p>And we learned in this week lectures and videos about a lot of things we share with computers, and that we can
        learn and actually apply,
        directly with the use of them, such as learning about how to prevent unwanted situations as black boxes in
        planes do. </p>
      <p>Another great take that I’ll keep is all of that really useful information about testing, how it goes beyond
        just testing your code to prevent
        errors within its own flow, but how testing revolves around its own culture, the ways to implement it, the way
        you would want to work testing with
        people, and as the example given by Netflix, how powerful testing can get to be by creating and using our own
        tools to work against ourselves, in
        spite of helping us at the same time, as mentioned with the Chaos monkeys and all that derived from it, letting
        the company be prepared for all
        kinds of scenarios.</p>
      <p>We could also learn a lot about how some companies manage to deploy more products with a better rate of success
        than others with concepts like
        pretotyping, which somehow relates a little to how accurate the information is in the scientific method, while
        of course having a lot of
        differences work upon the same principle which is making sure of something by actually testing some of its
        parts, like the hypothesis.</p>
      <p>Last but not least we got the chance to learn a lot about people that we could think of as a role model in a
        lot of aspects, in this case Richard
        Feynman with all of his contributions, vision, and a lot of things that we can aspire to be at a certain level,
        people that inspire us to be better
        every day.</p>

    <h2>Week 3 essay</h2>
    <div class="essay" id="ensayo-3">
      <p>Being creative is one of the most important things a person who works
        developing things can be, creativity fuels the engine of development and
        makes productivity and polishing details easy, it’s the main source of
        new and improved things. However, creativity by itself is not enough in
        order to create, for creativity is messy and can tend to be chaotic, it
        is in that same chaos in which the many perspectives are born, and
        lightbulbs are turned on. Therefore, while creativity is one of the
        key parts of creating or developing something, we need something to
        encapsulate its parts and give it some order. </p>
      <p>Giving creativity guidelines and trying to make it stick to a certain
        structure is not often easy, since it doesn’t have a sorted nature.
        Developing something can end up really bad if we just rely on being
        creative, and we may find ourselves entangled into our own ball of
        yarn these ideas can be, all of that if we’re not cautious enough. </p>
      <p>Since one of the goals we strive for is productivity, we can’t afford
        stumbling upon ourselves and the little problems/mistakes that we can
        have while we create. That’s why we’re introduced to this new model of
        creating while we try to make sure there’s nothing wrong with the things
        we create, where test driven development takes place. As mentioned in
        “Inventing on principle”, it’s easier for us when we see the results of
        what we’re doing all the time, creativity is a very visual process
        sometimes, yet it’s not always possible for us to work with that model,
        and having tests that can keep track of the things that shouldn’t
        go wrong with our product without us having to keep those things
        “grabbed” so they don’t fall apart all the time, can give us much
        more freedom to use our hands to perform some other things. </p>
      <p>Keeping in mind that there can always be changes within your environment
        is what keeps things going forward, and while that can be uncomfortable
        sometimes, it’s what let us continue to grow, as we saw in the talk
        “What got you here, won’t get you there”. </p>
      <p>And while there are things that we may easily get the hang of quickly,
        there are some others that we may not. We’ve been introduced to quantum
        computers and their logic, and to some experiments that have shown us
        how they work in reality, the behaviors particles and atoms can have,
        how certain things may act different both when they are and not observed.</p>
      <p>Definitely all the lessons we’ve been learning plus the ones we learned
        this week we’ll be useful in our daily basis, the tools we’ve been introduced
        to when creating things such as the movie recommender in case we need to add
        certain functionality or just as simple as the probably not so simple test
        driven development and all that comes with it, are going to help us keep
        building enough knowledge to fulfill our objectives. </p>

    <h2>Week 2 essay</h2>
    <div class="essay" id="ensayo-2">
      <p>How important is to know yourself well? Very important, but why? </p>
      <p>Knowing yourself is definitely one of the most important things one can do, it helps you understand your
        strengths and weaknesses,
        lets you understand what you can do and what you may need to improve in order to accomplish something, lets you
        see the whole picture
        instead of focusing in small details not only about yourself but also about what surrounds you. </p>
      <p>This is especially important because we often feel as if we were perfect in many senses, we take a lot of
        things for granted and don’t
        care too much about working in our “opportunity areas”, this plays a very critical role when working in places
        where you need to understand
        tasks as a team, we are all part of something. </p>
      <p>And this same topic about being part of something is what keeps us all focused on improving those little areas
        of ourselves,
        those areas that we may find uncomfortable to work with, but that are a very important part of self-improvement.
        When we work as
        a team, we do it because of biological and evolutive reasons, we fight for the common good, for a common
        objective.</p>
      <p>No one is perfect/flawless, we all have certain areas that we could improve, and it’s important to let others
        know when we are not
        certain of something, trying to look like you know more than you do will create a false image and might lead to
        problems even more when
        working as a team, where others could be deceived by another’s person image of themselves. </p>
      <p>This last week’s material was focused mainly on making us understand how self-development works, in the sense
        of how one can improve
        their ways of working and handling problems, also how a person can learn many things fast. Also, how we work as
        a community and the
        way certain companies tend to do wrong practices with their environment which leads to chaotic or poorly
        organized structures of
        handling their “power”, ending up in organizational manipulation. </p>
      <p>We also reviewed some information about optimization, compression which talks about the processes to work with
        information for certain
        purposes like improving the performance of a webpage. </p>
      <p>We learned about the concept that programming languages are not ones better than the others, but are rather
        tools that we’ll be using
        depending on the project that we’re working in, and that we should be able to learn those fast so we can comply
        with the expectations
        people may have for us. </p>
      <p>All of these things are important once again for teamwork, we need to learn how to program well with others, we
        must aim to learning
        how to work together and be well organized while doing so, this way we’ll learn how to be productive and nor
        over complicate things for
        our teams, it’s all about teamwork and understanding the mindset of a good programmer. </p>

    <h2>Week 1 essay</h2>
    <div class="essay" id="ensayo-1">
      <p>This first week of Academy was really interesting, we had a lot of meetings of matters related to the company,
        such as the meetings with Office
        management and labs, what they do, what they develop, etc. We also had other meetings that treated matters like
        what we should and what we should
        not be doing with the equipment that they gave us to work throughout the program. There were some other topics
        involved in the meetings, there was
        for example, one about the opportunities pool and how it works for employees. This certainly helped us
        understand a lot more about the way the company
        works so we can think and be ready to comply with their guidelines and their philosophy. We also started with
        the lightning talks this week, which at
        least to me sounded like a wild concept because of the way in which we’re supposed to make more in less time
        after each presentation we do, that
        simultaneously will definitely help us be more concise and practical about the way we deliver information. This
        week’s readings were all talking about
        a specific topic; However, I can see how they are all meant to make us start to think in a certain way, a way
        that is (as I assume) strategically planned
        within the company’s mental environment, which I find amazing so far. These readings are starting to make us
        understand precisely what the mail’s title is
        about, innovation and hard/smart work. With all of this information we’re developing certain ideas and therefore
        starting to adjust our way of thinking
        related to specific areas of knowledge and work, from learning how to be creative and let our co-workers help us
        with creativity to understanding all of
        that creativity and ideas mean nothing if those are not put into practice. All of our ideas have to be good, but
        for those ideas to be good we also need
        to be assertive, and also be good with the way we show our ideas and thoughts to others (like we’ve read in “how
        to talk to anyone”). Under this same
        philosophy we can understand that for these ideas to work we need to execute them in a way that is as bright as
        the ideas themselves, therefore we are
        in need of methods that let us work in our projects (the ideas) in that same way, in a workflow that makes the
        process easy and neat, not making us work
        more than we should, and the way to achieve that is certainly with processes that work step by step and focus in
        problem solving so we can be sure of
        what we’re doing as much as we can. Programmers usually are in the need of working in teams for large projects,
        that’s why it’s really important to
        realize why we should be always thinking about making things easier for our teammates. As mentioned in the
        “Religion, evolution and ecstasy of
        self-transcendence", humans decide to work as a team and forget about that thought of individuality for
        evolutive reasons, the need and wish to
        prevail is what at a certain point makes us strive to be our very best selves so we can do well in our small
        portion to help to society. None of
        these things are easy and to achieve them we must struggle with some obstacles that we may face along the way,
        but if we find a way to progress a
        little every day and we do it continuously it is possible for results to be reflected in a short period of time,
        and we’ll be able to start mastering
        things we thought we couldn’t ever master or even do. The combination of hard work, being self-conscious, always
        having well defined objectives and
        thinking in how you can help others/your colleagues improve as a whole, may seem like a really tough task to
        accomplish and could sound like a lot
        of work, probably too much to handle at the beginning, but it’s (once again), all in the execution, starting to
        do anything is always the hardest
        part, but as the days go by you will start getting the hang of it, creating your own rhythm and if you’re
        persistent and smart enough, you won’t even
        notice it cause it will get so easy and so normal for you that when you look back and stare at all the work that
        has been already done you’ll probably
        not believe it, but those are the products of evolving as a person, as a worker, as a thinker, as a being.</p>
