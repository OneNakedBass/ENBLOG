      <h2>Week 3 essay</h2>
      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-3">
        <p>Being creative is one of the most important things a person who works 
          developing things can be, creativity fuels the engine of development and
           makes productivity and polishing details easy, it’s the main source of 
           new and improved things. However, creativity by itself is not enough in
            order to create, for creativity is messy and can tend to be chaotic, it
             is in that same chaos in which the many perspectives are born, and 
             lightbulbs are turned on. Therefore, while creativity is one of the 
             key parts of creating or developing something, we need something to 
             encapsulate its parts and give it some order. </p>
          <p>Giving creativity guidelines and trying to make it stick to a certain 
            structure is not often easy, since it doesn’t have a sorted nature. 
            Developing something can end up really bad if we just rely on being 
            creative, and we may find ourselves entangled into our own ball of 
            yarn these ideas can be, all of that if we’re not cautious enough. </p>
          <p>Since one of the goals we strive for is productivity, we can’t afford 
            stumbling upon ourselves and the little problems/mistakes that we can 
            have while we create. That’s why we’re introduced to this new model of 
            creating while we try to make sure there’s nothing wrong with the things
             we create, where test driven development takes place. As mentioned in 
             “Inventing on principle”, it’s easier for us when we see the results of
              what we’re doing all the time, creativity is a very visual process 
              sometimes, yet it’s not always possible for us to work with that model,
               and having tests that can keep track of the things that shouldn’t 
               go wrong with our product without us having to keep those things 
               “grabbed” so they don’t fall apart all the time, can give us much 
               more freedom to use our hands to perform some other things. </p>
            <p>Keeping in mind that there can always be changes within your environment
               is what keeps things going forward, and while that can be uncomfortable 
               sometimes, it’s what let us continue to grow, as we saw in the talk 
               “What got you here, won’t get you there”. </p>    
            <p>And while there are things that we may easily get the hang of quickly,
               there are some others that we may not. We’ve been introduced to quantum 
               computers and their logic, and to some experiments that have shown us 
               how they work in reality, the behaviors particles and atoms can have, 
               how certain things may act different both when they are and not observed.</p>
            <p>Definitely all the lessons we’ve been learning plus the ones we learned 
              this week we’ll be useful in our daily basis, the tools we’ve been introduced
               to when creating things such as the movie recommender in case we need to add 
               certain functionality or just as simple as the probably not so simple test 
               driven development and all that comes with it, are going to help us keep
                building enough knowledge to fulfill our objectives. </p>

      <h2>Week 2 essay</h2>
      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-2">
      <p>How important is to know yourself well? Very important, but why? </p>
      <p>Knowing yourself is definitely one of the most important things one can do, it helps you understand your strengths and weaknesses, 
        lets you understand what you can do and what you may need to improve in order to accomplish something, lets you see the whole picture 
        instead of focusing in small details not only about yourself but also about what surrounds you. </p>
      <p>This is especially important because we often feel as if we were perfect in many senses, we take a lot of things for granted and don’t 
        care too much about working in our “opportunity areas”, this plays a very critical role when working in places where you need to understand
         tasks as a team, we are all part of something. </p>
      <p>And this same topic about being part of something is what keeps us all focused on improving those little areas of ourselves, 
        those areas that we may find uncomfortable to work with, but that are a very important part of self-improvement. When we work as
         a team, we do it because of biological and evolutive reasons, we fight for the common good, for a common objective.</p>
      <p>No one is perfect/flawless, we all have certain areas that we could improve, and it’s important to let others know when we are not 
        certain of something, trying to look like you know more than you do will create a false image and might lead to problems even more when 
        working as a team, where others could be deceived by another’s person image of themselves.  </p>
      <p>This last week’s material was focused mainly on making us understand how self-development works, in the sense of how one can improve 
        their ways of working and handling problems, also how a person can learn many things fast. Also, how we work as a community and the 
        way certain companies tend to do wrong practices with their environment	which leads to chaotic or poorly organized structures of 
        handling their “power”, ending up in organizational manipulation. </p>
      <p>We also reviewed some information about optimization, compression which talks about the processes to work with information for certain 
        purposes like improving the performance of a webpage. </p>
      <p>We learned about the concept that programming languages are not ones better than the others, but are rather tools that we’ll be using
         depending on the project that we’re working in, and that we should be able to learn those fast so we can comply with the expectations 
         people may have for us.  </p>
      <p>All of these things are important once again for teamwork, we need to learn how to program well with others, we must aim to learning
         how to work together and be well organized while doing so, this way we’ll learn how to be productive and nor over complicate things for
          our teams, it’s all about teamwork and understanding the mindset of a good programmer.  </p>

      <h2>Week 1 essay</h2>
      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-1">
      <p>This first week of Academy was really interesting, we had a lot of meetings of matters related to the company, such as the meetings with Office
      management and labs, what they do, what they develop, etc. We also had other meetings that treated matters like what we should and what we should 
      not be doing with the equipment that they gave us to work throughout the program. There were some other topics involved in the meetings, there was 
      for example, one about the opportunities pool and how it works for employees. This certainly helped us understand a lot more about the way the company
      works so we can think and be ready to comply with their guidelines and their philosophy. We also started with the lightning talks this week, which at 
      least to me sounded like a wild concept because of the way in which we’re supposed to make more in less time after each presentation we do, that 
      simultaneously will definitely help us be more concise and practical about the way we deliver information. This week’s readings were all talking about
      a specific topic; However, I can see how they are all meant to make us start to think in a certain way, a way that is (as I assume) strategically planned
      within the company’s mental environment, which I find amazing so far. These readings are starting to make us understand precisely what the mail’s title is
      about, innovation and hard/smart work. With all of this information we’re developing certain ideas and therefore starting to adjust our way of thinking 
      related to specific areas of knowledge and work, from learning how to be creative and let our co-workers help us with creativity to understanding all of 
      that creativity and ideas mean nothing if those are not put into practice. All of our ideas have to be good, but for those ideas to be good we also need 
      to be assertive, and also be good with the way we show our ideas and thoughts to others (like we’ve read in “how to talk to anyone”). Under this same 
      philosophy we can understand that for these ideas to work we need to execute them in a way that is as bright as the ideas themselves, therefore we are 
      in need of methods that let us work in our projects (the ideas) in that same way, in a workflow that makes the process easy and neat, not making us work
      more than we should, and the way to achieve that is certainly with processes that work step by step and focus in problem solving so we can be sure of 
      what we’re doing as much as we can. Programmers usually are in the need of working in teams for large projects, that’s why it’s really important to 
      realize why we should be always thinking about making things easier for our teammates. As mentioned in the “Religion, evolution and ecstasy of 
      self-transcendence", humans decide to work as a team and forget about that thought of individuality for evolutive reasons, the need and wish to 
      prevail is what at a certain point makes us strive to be our very best selves so we can do well in our small portion to help to society. None of 
      these things are easy and to achieve them we must struggle with some obstacles that we may face along the way, but if we find a way to progress a 
      little every day and we do it continuously it is possible for results to be reflected in a short period of time, and we’ll be able to start mastering
      things we thought we couldn’t ever master or even do. The combination of hard work, being self-conscious, always having well defined objectives and 
      thinking in how you can help others/your colleagues improve as a whole, may seem like a really tough task to accomplish and could sound like a lot 
      of work, probably too much to handle at the beginning, but it’s (once again), all in the execution, starting to do anything is always the hardest 
      part, but as the days go by you will start getting the hang of it, creating your own rhythm and if you’re persistent and smart enough, you won’t even
      notice it cause it will get so easy and so normal for you that when you look back and stare at all the work that has been already done you’ll probably
      not believe it, but those are the products of evolving as a person, as a worker, as a thinker, as a being.</p>
