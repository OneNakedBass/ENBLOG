      <h2>Week 9 Essay</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>This last week in the Academy definitely felt different than the rest, it was in a certain way a little more laid back
          than the others, probably because we already understood how we work as a team after a month of doing so, and everything
          was a little better organized than before.</p>
        
        <p>The knowledge that we’ve been acquiring over these weeks is really something that I wasn’t expecting to get, because
          even though I feel like I may not be learning that much every day, when I look back and think of what I knew before, I
          realize how much I've really learned and that makes me feel like I'm really progressing, which of course makes me feel
          more comfortable with the work I'm doing.</p>
        
        <p>And not only myself but I also recognize and see how my teammates are progressing incredibly well, it’s really
          interesting to see how people can evolve so quickly in such a good way.</p>
        
        <p>The fact that we’ve been working in a project has made us learn a lot of new things, though of course these things are
          totally related and work in the environment of the project, they are definitely going to help us and be useful when we
          start working in something different, even if that’s totally unrelated to this project.</p>
        
        <p>There are of course certain things that we struggled with, and that we’re still trying to get the hang of, and even
          though sometimes it feels like you’re reaching the “final lap” and that you will eventually not have to struggle that
          much, I've realized it’s part of what being a developer is all about, and it’s not about reaching a certain amount of
          knowledge or level, but getting used to this way of continuously learning and adapting to new things.</p>
        
        <p>We reached the goals that we had for this week, we feel good for now, I feel good for now, and I'm excite to see what
          the new phase of the Academy will bring, a little scared too, but that’s just part of it.</p>

      <h2>Week 8 Essay</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>There’s a phrase that we learned here in the Academy that keeps on coming back to my mind every single day since a few
          weeks ago, and it is that programming is much more about dealing with people than dealing with computers. I remember
          that because in fact, now that we’re working on a project, it’s an everyday thing, talk with your teammates, be in
          meetings, talk with your mentors and teams, talk with your clients, and of course, to deal with every aspect that comes
          with it.</p>
        
        <p>With this I definitely don’t mean that it’s a struggle, there are of course some struggles, but it’s not the whole
          thing, in fact in can be quite fulfilling and you can learn a lot from it, which of course gives you a lot to think and
          leaves you with a feeling of progress.</p>
        
        <p>From my perspective I can say that I’ve struggled more than computers than with people for the moment, and this because
          my team is full of people that I totally respect, they are so smart and charming, I really like these people, and
          working with them makes everything much easier, or better at least.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve been having some issues with my own knowledge, most of the time I feel like I don’t catch certain concepts as fast
          as my colleagues, and of course this is reflected in how fast I can work, how I deliver results. This hasn’t made it
          easier for me, since often the thoughts of me becoming a burden for the team fly around my head.</p>
        
        <p>This doesn’t mean that I'm totally down and crying on the floor (although I scream inside every now and then), but have
          been working extra hard and studied more in both content and hours than I’ve ever done before, and while this is of
          course, tiring, it’s what I have to do if I really want to progress and overcome these barriers that have been stopping
          me from going to “the next level”.</p>
        
        <p>I’ve been learning a lot about the front end, JavaScript and React, tried to learn more and more concepts, and things
          that maybe I skipped or didn’t realize were there because of not having a computer science background, I feel very
          motivated but at the same time I feel a little scared of not learning enough to make it with what the Academy expects
          from us, and though this may sound negative, I don’t mean it that way, I guess it’s just my way to say that I'll try and
          see what is there for me.</p>
        
        <p>But will keep on trying, definitely will keep on trying.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Week 7 Essay</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>They say that is in our darkest or toughest moments when we find the inspiration to get up and do something instead of
          just complaining about it and let yourself fade. I think in a certain way I hit a spiritual rock bottom because of the
          feeling of not doing or being enough, al derived from the fact that I struggled like never before with the tasks or the
          material that I should learn for the current project we’re working on.</p>
        
        <p>This week we’ve been working extra hard with the project for our client and honestly, I hadn’t felt this pressure since
          the Academy started, not only because it is really an important project but also because of the work we’re supposed to
          do here.</p>
        
        <p>It’s taken us to the extreme, for some of us that had never worked as a team of developers before, applying agile
          practices for example, dividing certain tasks and having to think all the time on how those tasks correlate with what
          our colleagues are doing at the moment, every single step has to be given some thought in order for it to work.</p>
        
        <p>And I’ve felt weak for a few days, not only in spirit but also as a developer, started feeling certain lack of knowledge
          or that I was probably not good enough, took me a while to understand that we may come from different backgrounds and
          that we’re all learning at a different pace, even though we’re working on the same things.</p>
        
        <p>And after all of this I still feel really glad and fortunate that I've been given the chance to prove myself, and
          twisted that mentality, instead of letting myself down decided to fight until the last moment, learning as much JS and
          React in this case as I can everyday so I can develop some skill, and of course, the app.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Week 6 Essay</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>It is really curious how humans are able to “shape” to whatever they need to, how we evolve and adapt to survive, and
          not only to survive, but sometimes in search of self-improvement. Some other times this change comes naturally when we
          are in need, when the situation requires it, and that is a big part of our life cycle.
          </p>

        <p>I’ve felt this pressure to adapt a lot of times in my life, sometimes it’s been tough to do it, and other times I've
          liked it and felt excited about it. Anyway, it’s always been an interesting and cultivating experience, we are curious
          beings and though at times we feel challenged and afraid of diving into the unknown, we transcend through doing these
          things.
          </p>

        <P>Since we started the academy, it’s been a constant cycle of learning, sometimes you even think before going to sleep,
          and after you wake up, you think all the time in what you’re doing, never learned so fast before, and I am now adapting
          to this new process, this new phase, actually building something, and yes, it is from scratch.
          </P>

        <P>This process has been challenging and interesting, because even when we read a lot of material about agile and planning
          how to work on a project, it’s a totally different thing to actually do it, now I understand what they meant by “Coding
          is more about dealing with people than with machines”, and I'm starting to dig it.</P>

        
        <P>Working and thinking all the time in what we should do, how we should do it, why we should do it, is it suitable? is it
          going to give us nightmares? will it actually be helpful or will the client like it? Lots of questions and not so many
          answers, guess we’ll have to get them on the way. But it’s amazing to apply the acquired knowledge in a project, to
          understand every piece because black swans don’t give you a notice in advance, thinking about making you program robust
          and prevent it from being fragile, understanding how to work as a team, every piece of what we can take from the past
          and the present will help us build now and in the future.</P>

      <h2>Review of Make it stick</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>I think this book was right in pretty much everything that was written in it, and reminded me a lot about the coursera
          course of learning how to learn because they go through a lot of the same concepts but probably seen in different ways,
          which also makes it interesting, because it reinforces the ideas while explaining different methods to do so.</p>
        
        <p>The book talks about how we learn, how we often think that we are learning based on the methods that we use to learn and
          of course how we may be doing it in the wrong way, as we often rely on repetition-based learning which ends up not
          actually adding up to our brain development.</p>
        
        <p>So, since the way we often learn may be incorrect and we are probably wasting more time than we should or not learning
          as much because of these issues we got in derived by our ways of learning, it’s time to fix those little problems and
          these misconceptions we have about it so we can improve, and this has a lot to do with the mentioned illusions of
          knowing and the myths surrounding them.</p>
        
        <p>Some of the things that are repeated through the steps this book covers are also covered in the other course mentioned,
          and those are the spaced repetition and also interleaving which pretty much consists in keeping up with the knowledge
          you get so you store in in your long-term memory, and to make your studying sessions diverse so you can maintain your
          concentration as much as possible.</p>
        
        <p>To be honest at certain point I felt like this book was going over and over through the same concepts but just
          explaining the with different words and that they could have save so much time if they were a little more concise, but
          of course, since the book was meant for people in general for learning these concepts we can’t just assume it will be
          the same for everyone, we all learn different, but luckily, we can all use the same techniques to improve the way we
          learn which is the main objective of the book.</p>

      </div>

      <h2>Review of Code: The Hidden Language of Computer Hardware & Software</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>Code, was easily one of the most complete books I've ever read about how computers work, it explains very exhaustively
          every single detail about how computers were made, and it does it covering a lot of aspects, that in the beginning may
          not be or feel like they are related with computing, but each bit of information that’s explained there is well thought
          and translates into very important knowledge that will help us understand better how something works, and why it works
          when taken to the computers world.</p>

        <p>The fact that it begins explaining about how morse code works and relating it to the binary concept of how computers
          understand the simplest orders is a very good example of it.</p>

        <p>Passing right after that to de-chunking how flashlights work and how we can use them to communicate under the same
          binary concept, from the easiest parts to the more complicated ones, always trying to improve communication and using it
          for the best, to later on move onto how this same principle was taken to the telegraph and simultaneously how they
          solved the problems with its intensity by explaining each electrical problem they had with it in a very detailed way.
          </p>
        <p>All of this knowledge ends up used to make us understand how we used all of these components we already had and were
          able to “branch” decisions via the boolean values, how processors work and the way all of these parts work together to
          create the first computers.</p>
        
        <p>Without a doubt this book is something that goes beyond my expectations in a matter of how complete it was and also
          regarding the material and the way the development of its material is, I feel like they couldn’t have been clearer with
          a lot of concepts, such as when it starts talking about software and how to write it with the “machine code”.</p>
        
        <p>Definitely a book worth reading if you’re interested in computers and software development, but even more if you’re
          someone who actually cares about the functionality of each single part of it, because it goes over every step with a lot
          of detail, which makes it much more interesting than to just explain the main concept and moving on.</p>

      </div>


      <h2>Opinion about the course "Learn how to learn"</h2>

      <div class="essay">

        <p>Reading the learn how to learn course was a very interesting thing for me, because honestly at the beginning I felt like
          it would be a total waste of my time, and I thought this because we had a class about this exact same thing at my
          university and I learned nothing in a whole semester, the class was boring, the material they taught us was not really
          useful and the teacher never really looked like she cared about it either, actually at a certain point she said she was
          there just to fill her schedule, so you can guess it wasn’t good at all.</p>
        <p>
          But how wrong I was to compare this course to the class that I previously had; those were totally different worlds. In
          this course I was able to learn step by step what I was doing wrong with a lot of my learning methods and also about the
          things that I did wrong no matter what I was learning at the moment.</p>
        <p>
          They talked and covered subjects from really easy topics and little details that one can actually notice in plain sight
          to very complicated stuff and techniques, explaining how those affect the way our brains and the way in which we acquire
          new knowledge.</p>
        
        <P>We also learned a lot about how our brains process the information and learned some very good and interesting things
          about neuro science, the fact that exercising could help you keep your neurons healthy or sleeping could create new
          space for synapses to help us with learning much better, those were things that I would have never imagined, and
          definitely will be putting more attention to.
          </P>
        <P>Every little thing that I learned from the course will remain in my memory and I'll practice it and go over it again so
          I can (as mentioned in the course) keep it in my long-term memory, cause these chunks of information I got deserve a
          very special place in my head, where I'll be storing much more knowledge.
          </P>

      <h2>Monthly essay no.1</h2>

      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-mensual-1">

        <p>This first month in Encoracademy has been definitely a rollercoaster in a lot of senses to me, it’s been a lot of things
          but easy, it has challenged me in so many ways that I could hardly explain it or put it in words, not only because we
          are constantly learning and at times, I may feel overwhelmed, and at certain points I feel that I’m maybe not good
          enough or that I simply cannot get in the right motion to get along with this project’s pace.</p>
        
        <p>It has put me in rough situations where I've been forced to get to a level of commitment that I was probably not used
          to, and of course that I'm making an incredibly tough effort to somewhat be at the level of my colleagues. That is also
          something that has made me deceive myself as well, the impostor’s syndrome has hit hard and gotten me really bad at
          certain times, I had been warned that this would be tough and of course that some things are easier said than done, but
          I said that I'd do it and here I am, which makes me feel really grateful.</p>
        
        <p>Even though one can feel that you have everything against you every now and then, I look back a month ago and realize
          that I have probably not been putting enough attention on the positive sides of this, because I wouldn’t have imagined
          to learn so much in such a short time, and I realize now that everything involved in the material and the lessons we
          receive from our mentors and all the team in the Academy are slowly and softly changing us from head to toe, in a good
          way of course.</p>
        
        <p>We’re learning so much and so fast, building this knowledge, this mindset every single day, sometimes hidden in the
          tasks that we got, that we don’t even notice, it took me until a few days ago to start actually realizing all of this
          and when it clicked, it made me understand that this may be what overcoming yourself could feel like.</p>
        
        <p>This I say it cause I've failed, and I’ve had to recognize my failures, just to realize that this was all part of what
          would improve the way I do things, and I now feel empowered to try so many things in a lot of different ways, the
          courses about learning, the tasks we’ve gotten as a team, the meetings, the lessons, the lectures and the videos,
          everything has been forming me and now I'm starting to actually embrace and let the knowledge run through my veins (yes
          I'm being over dramatic here).</p>
        
        <p>No one warned me that when welcomed to the magic, the magic would hit this way, but I understand now what it consists
          of, and I'm more than ready to continue becoming a wizard, if that makes any sense.</p>

      <h2>Week 4 essay</h2>

      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-4">
        <p>What a ride the one we’re on right now, the beginning was unknown, the road got some weird turns and the future, well, the future remains
          uncertain. What are we speaking of, though? Are we talking about a rollercoaster ride, a Sunday afternoon car drive, a year that unexpectedly 
          went weird, your journey in this new job you got, the universe, life itself? Well, while those can be identified as rides, we could be talking
           about each one of them at the same time, at the end of the day, aren’t those all co-existing just the way we humans co-exist with one another? </p>
        <p>As mentioned by Seth Lloyd we could be immersed in this universe where our species created these computers that allow us to create and work to
           create things inside the ones that were already created, and well, it goes on and on.   </p>
        <p>The universe may be creating its own instances of matter in order to let some other parts of it create some other things using that same matter
           as an argument passed to its inner functions, initializing life, instantiating all we know, and everything we’ve inherited from the beginning of
            times until this moment in which we’ve began to wonder if isn’t life itself a big computer.</p>
        <p>And we learned in this week lectures and videos about a lot of things we share with computers, and that we can learn and actually apply, 
          directly with the use of them, such as learning about how to prevent unwanted situations as black boxes in planes do. </p>
        <p>Another great take that I’ll keep is all of that really useful information about testing, how it goes beyond just testing your code to prevent
           errors within its own flow, but how testing revolves around its own culture, the ways to implement it, the way you would want to work testing with 
           people, and as the example given by Netflix, how powerful testing can get to be by creating and using our own tools to work against ourselves, in 
           spite of helping us at the same time, as mentioned with the Chaos monkeys and all that derived from it, letting the company be prepared for all 
           kinds of scenarios.</p>
        <p>We could also learn a lot about how some companies manage to deploy more products with a better rate of success than others with concepts like
           pretotyping, which somehow relates a little to how accurate the information is in the scientific method, while of course having a lot of
            differences work upon the same principle which is making sure of something by actually testing some of its parts, like the hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Last but not least we got the chance to learn a lot about people that we could think of as a role model in a lot of aspects, in this case Richard 
          Feynman with all of his contributions, vision, and a lot of things that we can aspire to be at a certain level, people that inspire us to be better 
          every day.</p>

      <h2>Week 3 essay</h2>
      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-3">
        <p>Being creative is one of the most important things a person who works 
          developing things can be, creativity fuels the engine of development and
           makes productivity and polishing details easy, it’s the main source of 
           new and improved things. However, creativity by itself is not enough in
            order to create, for creativity is messy and can tend to be chaotic, it
             is in that same chaos in which the many perspectives are born, and 
             lightbulbs are turned on. Therefore, while creativity is one of the 
             key parts of creating or developing something, we need something to 
             encapsulate its parts and give it some order. </p>
          <p>Giving creativity guidelines and trying to make it stick to a certain 
            structure is not often easy, since it doesn’t have a sorted nature. 
            Developing something can end up really bad if we just rely on being 
            creative, and we may find ourselves entangled into our own ball of 
            yarn these ideas can be, all of that if we’re not cautious enough. </p>
          <p>Since one of the goals we strive for is productivity, we can’t afford 
            stumbling upon ourselves and the little problems/mistakes that we can 
            have while we create. That’s why we’re introduced to this new model of 
            creating while we try to make sure there’s nothing wrong with the things
             we create, where test driven development takes place. As mentioned in 
             “Inventing on principle”, it’s easier for us when we see the results of
              what we’re doing all the time, creativity is a very visual process 
              sometimes, yet it’s not always possible for us to work with that model,
               and having tests that can keep track of the things that shouldn’t 
               go wrong with our product without us having to keep those things 
               “grabbed” so they don’t fall apart all the time, can give us much 
               more freedom to use our hands to perform some other things. </p>
            <p>Keeping in mind that there can always be changes within your environment
               is what keeps things going forward, and while that can be uncomfortable 
               sometimes, it’s what let us continue to grow, as we saw in the talk 
               “What got you here, won’t get you there”. </p>    
            <p>And while there are things that we may easily get the hang of quickly,
               there are some others that we may not. We’ve been introduced to quantum 
               computers and their logic, and to some experiments that have shown us 
               how they work in reality, the behaviors particles and atoms can have, 
               how certain things may act different both when they are and not observed.</p>
            <p>Definitely all the lessons we’ve been learning plus the ones we learned 
              this week we’ll be useful in our daily basis, the tools we’ve been introduced
               to when creating things such as the movie recommender in case we need to add 
               certain functionality or just as simple as the probably not so simple test 
               driven development and all that comes with it, are going to help us keep
                building enough knowledge to fulfill our objectives. </p>

      <h2>Week 2 essay</h2>

      <p>How important is to know yourself well? Very important, but why? </p>
      <p>Knowing yourself is definitely one of the most important things one can do, it helps you understand your strengths and weaknesses, 
        lets you understand what you can do and what you may need to improve in order to accomplish something, lets you see the whole picture 
        instead of focusing in small details not only about yourself but also about what surrounds you. </p>
      <p>This is especially important because we often feel as if we were perfect in many senses, we take a lot of things for granted and don’t 
        care too much about working in our “opportunity areas”, this plays a very critical role when working in places where you need to understand
         tasks as a team, we are all part of something. </p>
      <p>And this same topic about being part of something is what keeps us all focused on improving those little areas of ourselves, 
        those areas that we may find uncomfortable to work with, but that are a very important part of self-improvement. When we work as
         a team, we do it because of biological and evolutive reasons, we fight for the common good, for a common objective.</p>
      <p>No one is perfect/flawless, we all have certain areas that we could improve, and it’s important to let others know when we are not 
        certain of something, trying to look like you know more than you do will create a false image and might lead to problems even more when 
        working as a team, where others could be deceived by another’s person image of themselves.  </p>
      <p>This last week’s material was focused mainly on making us understand how self-development works, in the sense of how one can improve 
        their ways of working and handling problems, also how a person can learn many things fast. Also, how we work as a community and the 
        way certain companies tend to do wrong practices with their environment	which leads to chaotic or poorly organized structures of 
        handling their “power”, ending up in organizational manipulation. </p>
      <p>We also reviewed some information about optimization, compression which talks about the processes to work with information for certain 
        purposes like improving the performance of a webpage. </p>
      <p>We learned about the concept that programming languages are not ones better than the others, but are rather tools that we’ll be using
         depending on the project that we’re working in, and that we should be able to learn those fast so we can comply with the expectations 
         people may have for us.  </p>
      <p>All of these things are important once again for teamwork, we need to learn how to program well with others, we must aim to learning
         how to work together and be well organized while doing so, this way we’ll learn how to be productive and nor over complicate things for
          our teams, it’s all about teamwork and understanding the mindset of a good programmer.  </p>

      <h2>Week 1 essay</h2>
      <div class="essay" id="ensayo-1">
      <p>This first week of Academy was really interesting, we had a lot of meetings of matters related to the company, such as the meetings with Office
      management and labs, what they do, what they develop, etc. We also had other meetings that treated matters like what we should and what we should 
      not be doing with the equipment that they gave us to work throughout the program. There were some other topics involved in the meetings, there was 
      for example, one about the opportunities pool and how it works for employees. This certainly helped us understand a lot more about the way the company
      works so we can think and be ready to comply with their guidelines and their philosophy. We also started with the lightning talks this week, which at 
      least to me sounded like a wild concept because of the way in which we’re supposed to make more in less time after each presentation we do, that 
      simultaneously will definitely help us be more concise and practical about the way we deliver information. This week’s readings were all talking about
      a specific topic; However, I can see how they are all meant to make us start to think in a certain way, a way that is (as I assume) strategically planned
      within the company’s mental environment, which I find amazing so far. These readings are starting to make us understand precisely what the mail’s title is
      about, innovation and hard/smart work. With all of this information we’re developing certain ideas and therefore starting to adjust our way of thinking 
      related to specific areas of knowledge and work, from learning how to be creative and let our co-workers help us with creativity to understanding all of 
      that creativity and ideas mean nothing if those are not put into practice. All of our ideas have to be good, but for those ideas to be good we also need 
      to be assertive, and also be good with the way we show our ideas and thoughts to others (like we’ve read in “how to talk to anyone”). Under this same 
      philosophy we can understand that for these ideas to work we need to execute them in a way that is as bright as the ideas themselves, therefore we are 
      in need of methods that let us work in our projects (the ideas) in that same way, in a workflow that makes the process easy and neat, not making us work
      more than we should, and the way to achieve that is certainly with processes that work step by step and focus in problem solving so we can be sure of 
      what we’re doing as much as we can. Programmers usually are in the need of working in teams for large projects, that’s why it’s really important to 
      realize why we should be always thinking about making things easier for our teammates. As mentioned in the “Religion, evolution and ecstasy of 
      self-transcendence", humans decide to work as a team and forget about that thought of individuality for evolutive reasons, the need and wish to 
      prevail is what at a certain point makes us strive to be our very best selves so we can do well in our small portion to help to society. None of 
      these things are easy and to achieve them we must struggle with some obstacles that we may face along the way, but if we find a way to progress a 
      little every day and we do it continuously it is possible for results to be reflected in a short period of time, and we’ll be able to start mastering
      things we thought we couldn’t ever master or even do. The combination of hard work, being self-conscious, always having well defined objectives and 
      thinking in how you can help others/your colleagues improve as a whole, may seem like a really tough task to accomplish and could sound like a lot 
      of work, probably too much to handle at the beginning, but it’s (once again), all in the execution, starting to do anything is always the hardest 
      part, but as the days go by you will start getting the hang of it, creating your own rhythm and if you’re persistent and smart enough, you won’t even
      notice it cause it will get so easy and so normal for you that when you look back and stare at all the work that has been already done you’ll probably
      not believe it, but those are the products of evolving as a person, as a worker, as a thinker, as a being.</p>
