      <h1>Hello!</h1>
      <p class="essay">This first week of Academy was really interesting, we had a lot of meetings of matters related to the company, such as the meetings with Office
      management and labs, what they do, what they develop, etc. We also had other meetings that treated matters like what we should and what we should 
      not be doing with the equipment that they gave us to work throughout the program. There were some other topics involved in the meetings, there was 
      for example, one about the opportunities pool and how it works for employees. This certainly helped us understand a lot more about the way the company
      works so we can think and be ready to comply with their guidelines and their philosophy. We also started with the lightning talks this week, which at 
      least to me sounded like a wild concept because of the way in which we’re supposed to make more in less time after each presentation we do, that 
      simultaneously will definitely help us be more concise and practical about the way we deliver information. This week’s readings were all talking about
      a specific topic; However, I can see how they are all meant to make us start to think in a certain way, a way that is (as I assume) strategically planned
      within the company’s mental environment, which I find amazing so far. These readings are starting to make us understand precisely what the mail’s title is
      about, innovation and hard/smart work. With all of this information we’re developing certain ideas and therefore starting to adjust our way of thinking 
      related to specific areas of knowledge and work, from learning how to be creative and let our co-workers help us with creativity to understanding all of 
      that creativity and ideas mean nothing if those are not put into practice. All of our ideas have to be good, but for those ideas to be good we also need 
      to be assertive, and also be good with the way we show our ideas and thoughts to others (like we’ve read in “how to talk to anyone”). Under this same 
      philosophy we can understand that for these ideas to work we need to execute them in a way that is as bright as the ideas themselves, therefore we are 
      in need of methods that let us work in our projects (the ideas) in that same way, in a workflow that makes the process easy and neat, not making us work
      more than we should, and the way to achieve that is certainly with processes that work step by step and focus in problem solving so we can be sure of 
      what we’re doing as much as we can. Programmers usually are in the need of working in teams for large projects, that’s why it’s really important to 
      realize why we should be always thinking about making things easier for our teammates. As mentioned in the “Religion, evolution and ecstasy of 
      self-transcendence", humans decide to work as a team and forget about that thought of individuality for evolutive reasons, the need and wish to 
      prevail is what at a certain point makes us strive to be our very best selves so we can do well in our small portion to help to society. None of 
      these things are easy and to achieve them we must struggle with some obstacles that we may face along the way, but if we find a way to progress a 
      little every day and we do it continuously it is possible for results to be reflected in a short period of time, and we’ll be able to start mastering
      things we thought we couldn’t ever master or even do. The combination of hard work, being self-conscious, always having well defined objectives and 
      thinking in how you can help others/your colleagues improve as a whole, may seem like a really tough task to accomplish and could sound like a lot 
      of work, probably too much to handle at the beginning, but it’s (once again), all in the execution, starting to do anything is always the hardest 
      part, but as the days go by you will start getting the hang of it, creating your own rhythm and if you’re persistent and smart enough, you won’t even
      notice it cause it will get so easy and so normal for you that when you look back and stare at all the work that has been already done you’ll probably
      not believe it, but those are the products of evolving as a person, as a worker, as a thinker, as a being.</p>
