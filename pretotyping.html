      <h2>Pretotyping experiments</h2>

      <h3>Introduction</h3>

      <div class="essay" id="Pretotyping">

        <p>In this report, we present three ideas that were tested by using the Pretotyping technique. Pretotyping is about trying
            a lot of ideas, translated into fast failures, increasing probabilities to find a successful idea. In this case, we
            began by discussing different ideas as a group and we filtered them through the question: “Would we use it?”.</p>
        <p>Finally, when we answered yes to the three ideas we moved one to the next stage, working on the pretotyping. In the next
            sections, you will be able to see our hypothesis and next if they were correct or not.
            </p>
        <p>Once the ideas were decided, the next thing to do was finding our pretotyping, in our case, we decided it was a good
            idea to create fake ads about the ideas and gather data about how many people would voluntarily click on the ad.</p>
        <p>Here are the ads we used:</p>
        </div>

        <h3>Courselet</h3>
        
        <div class="essay">
            <p>Click here if you would like to track the price and get recommendations of courses on any platform (e. g. Coursera,
                edx, udemy, udacity…) in a single place without having to visit other platforms separately and be aware of the
                discounts in your courses.

        </div>

        <h3>Gastracker - Gas price tracker</h3>

        <div class="essay">
            <p>Are you interested to know which fuel station in your city has the better prices so you can save some money?
                Click here if you’d like to know the prices of your local fuel stations in real-time.
                </p>

        </div>

        <h3>Knowsher - Knowledge sharer</h3>

        <div class="essay">
            <p>Would you like to use an app in which you can search for abilities that you want to learn in exchange for teaching
                something else? You don’t need to pay to learn, just to teach something else in return. In case you want it you can
                also pay a fee so you get access to it without having to teach something back.
            </p>

        </div>

        <h2>IDEA 1: Track and recommend course prices Courselet
        </h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="essay">Track the price and receive recommendations of courses in any platform (Coursera, edX, Udacity,
            Udemy...) everything in just one place without needing to visit each platform independently, follow discounts, and
            more.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="essay">Self-paced online learning and education have become popular in the last couple of years, and with the current problems due to the pandemic, people are interested in finding the best cost-benefit courses of all platforms in one single place. Everything from the comfort of their home. 
        </p>

        <h3>Experiment description</h3>
        <p class="essay">To find out what people think about this idea we put to the test fake ads through bitly URLs with a specific description of the service. This way we had the opportunity to discover if people would click on the link to find out more about the service. This is how we would have a first approximation about how feasible was our idea. 
        </p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p class="essay">We selected a group of people where we thought would be interested in the ideas. We share the link just as if it was a normal ad. 73% of the total number of people click on the link we share. 
            We can determine that people are interested in finding the best cost-benefit courses of all platforms in one single place. We cannot say that people are going to consume the product yet, but at least we can say they have an interest in it. 
            </p>

        <h3>results</h3>
        <p class="essay">From the data, we can determine that in fact, people are interested in finding their online courses in just one place and track prices to get discounts. Nevertheless, we aren’t sure yet that people would consistently consume our product. That’s why we should proceed with a new approach to gather more data, we could for example create a very simple prototype and see if we would use it. Then maybe another form could be to select a new and bigger group of people and allow them to test a version of the service.</p>   

        <h2>IDEA 2: Gas price tracker app
        </h2>

        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p class="essay">This app will track the prices of different gas stations in the city, then give you the best recommendation according to the distance and price. This app will help you save money the next time that you put gas in your car.
        </p>
        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="essay">The prices of the gas differ from each gas station. Searching for the best price of the gas is nowadays an interest for the people. </p>

        <h3>Experiment description</h3>
        <p class="essay">We shared a bitly link to find out if the idea was interesting and useful for the people. If the persons take their time to click on the link, we could know that they are interested in acquiring the service. This was our idea to test and confirm if our idea has true potential for the current market. </p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p class="essay">We select a group of target people who could be interested in our app related to the prices of the gas stations. 73% of persons of the groups showed interest in the application, clicking on the link.  
            According to this result, we can determine that people are interested in getting lower gas prices. We don’t know the true potential of our product, but at least the premise is enough to get the genuine interest of the people. 
            </p>

        <h3>results</h3>
        <p class="essay">With this data, we know that the idea is strong enough to keep going. The next step is to prove which is the right interface and user experience to keep the attention of the people. Creating a low-budget prototype and doing the same type of experiment will help us to get the right approach to the product. 
        </p>   



        <h2>IDEA 3: Knowledge exchange app</h2>

        <h3>Hypothesis</h3>
        <p class="essay">Learning is something that all people constantly seek. To be better people and better professionals, we must be constantly learning. To get a better job we must learn new things.

            During the Covid-19 pandemic, many people have been affected. Many have lost their jobs, and for those who did not have it, it has been much more difficult to find one.
            
            The best way to keep a job, get one, or even get a better one is to constantly gain knowledge. Learning is the only thing that can assure us that at some point we can succeed.
            </p>
        <p class="essay">The problem is that acquiring knowledge is not usually something accessible to all people, much less during a global crisis such as that caused by Covid-19. That is why many people during this crisis, even when they were willing to dedicate time to learn, could not do so because they did not have the way to access quality education.

            But it is also true that all people have something they can teach. All people have knowledge that they can share. That is why an application that allows the exchange of knowledge could be very helpful for those people who want to learn something new and do not have the resources to do so.
            </p>   
        <p class="essay">The most important resources we have are our time and our knowledge, that is why we can share them with someone else, and in exchange for that other people will be able to share their knowledge and time with us.
        </p> 


        <h3>Experiment description</h3>
        <p class="essay">To test whether people were interested in using an application in which they could exchange knowledge, we decided to share a link with the following description in several groups:
            "Would you like to be able to use an app in which you can look for skills that you want to learn in exchange for you teaching others? You do not need to pay to learn just to teach something to others in return. If you want, you can pay to have access without needing to teach anything".
            We think that if a person clicked on the link after reading the description, they did so because they were interested in using the application or at least knowing a little more about it.
            </p>

        <h3>Validation</h3>
        <p class="essay">As with the rest of our experiments we sent a link to some groups with the premise of having access to the app, as what would be an example of it. The link we used was a tool that let us verify how many people clicked on it after some time. In this case, we were able to verify in a matter of hours the interest people had in our app. While our validation of the data can’t tell how it would perform in a bigger population, it gives us fast and reliable information and feedback whether people are interested in the product as to click right away in hopes of finding the mentioned app, and this simple and fast process complies with the mindset of pretotyping, getting fast and concise feedback about your product.
        </p>

        <h3>results</h3>
        <p class="essay">We verified that at least 73% of the people we worked with for this study were interested in the idea of the knowledge exchange app since that is the percentage that clicked on the link. Of course, we could complement this information or increase the resources used to verify how the app could be tested in a more public way, though in this case there were some barriers as the pandemic which unfortunately stops us from being able to do an in-person study. Still, certain tests could be applied to see how people interacted with the app, but of course, there would need to be an implementation of it already and in this occasion, we just wanted to see how interesting it would be for a certain public, so we could fail or succeed quickly, to move onto the next step.
        </p>   

        <h2>Conclusions</h2>

        <p class="essay">The experiments went well, nevertheless, it is necessary to keep working on the following pretotypes and in larger groups of people to see how the idea evolves through gathering data. Once we get the idea that we want it would be a good idea to work on prototypes and then work on the right “it”. We need to keep working and failing fast. </p>
